**Please note that none of the assets used in the project were created by me.
  The aim of this project was to create a trash game using free, creative commons
  assets from the Unity Asset Store, itch.io and elsewhere on the internet.
  You can find references to all these assets in the AssetList.txt**

Rock of Ages is a Virtual Museum that showcases assets gathered from across the internet.
Most of them are rocks, and the rest are objects to compliment the rocks. While brainstorming
for this project I found there was a lot of different rock models, despite all being
fairly similar and, compared to other objects, quite mundane. The original plan was simply
to highlight some of the interesting elements of these objects, but this game now
includes more humour and a little bit of narrative to flesh that out.
